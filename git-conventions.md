# Git conventions

## Branchs

We will create one branch per functionality.

Model :  

| Sprint | Functionality / Component |
|:---:|:---:|
| Sprint 0 - | MCD |
| Sprint 1 - | Authentication |

Examples :  

- Sprint 0 - MCD  
- Sprint 1 - Authentication  
- Sprint 1 - Canvas  

## Commits

As soon as the tiniest snippet is working, we will commit the changes.  
Commits names are in lowercase except for official names and conventions.

Model :  

| Sprint | Day | Commit |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| S2 | .5 | : MainController done |
| S3 | .2 | : GUI impleted |

Examples :  

- S0.2 : functional-specifications done  
- S1.5 : canvas done  
- S2.3 : entities created  

## Merges

Only the Git Master can validate the merges (after a pull request).
